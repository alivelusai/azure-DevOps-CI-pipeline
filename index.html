    <p> Thangalaan received critical acclaim from critics, who praised the lead cast's performance (especially Vikram, Malavika Mohanan, Parvathy Thiruvothu and Daniel Caltagirone), GV Prakash Kumar's background score and Ranjith's screenplay and direction, but the CGI and VFX were criticised.[50]

M Suganth of The Times of India gave 4/5 stars and wrote "The film is a true-blue big-screen experience that immerses us into its world and keeps us glued with arresting visuals and intense drama."[51] Rohit Panikker of Times Now gave 4/5 and wrote "Thangalaan is a well-thought-of and well-produced experience in both visual and cerebral storytelling. What this film has managed to do is prove that magical realism and period dramas can work as well as any mass masala flick as long as the story is delivered with conviction. All in all, a definite theatre watch to feel the full effect of what the film's team has put together."[52] Avinash Ravichandran of The Indian Express gave 2/5 stars and wrote "Some of his [Ranjith] audacious attempts at storytelling in Thangalaan get overburdened by the novelty factor. He isn’t always ably supported by the technicalities of the film that keep us at an arm’s length at times."[53]

Janani K of India Today gave 1/5 stars and wrote "However, Thangalaan seems to be the weakest work in director Pa Ranjith's filmography. The film's screenplay is too abstract, which might not be everyone's cup of tea.[54] Latha Srinivasan of Hindustan Times wrote "Vikram has outdone himself in this film as Thangalaan and shows us how talented and committed he is, yet again. Whether it the emotional scenes or the action ones, Vikram makes you feel every emotion he goes through."[55]</p>
